      "- 5 Digestion and Metabolism of Carbohydrates John Mathers and Thomas MS Wolever Key messages • Carbohydrates are the single most abundant and economic sources of food energy in the human diet, constituting 40–80% of total energy intake in different populations.\n",
      "• Carbohydrates are classified according to their degree of polymerization into sugars, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides – the last consisting of starches with different degrees of resistance to digestion – and dietary fibers or nonstarch polysaccharides.\n",
      "• Glycemic carbohydrates are digested (hydrolyzed by enzymes) to sugars (monosaccharides) in the small bowel and absorbed and metabolized.\n",
      "• Nonglycemic carbohydrates are fermented in varying degrees to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and © 2009 J Mathers and TMS Wolever.\n",
      "methane in the large bowel. Absorbed SCFAs are metabolized in colonic epithelial, hepatic, and muscle cells.\n",
      "• For optimum function of the nervous system and other cells, blood glucose concentrations are tightly controlled by a group of hormones (insulin in the absorptive phase; glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol in the postabsorptive phase), utilizing several possible metabolic pathways for glucose anabolism and catabolism.\n",

      "Carbohydrates are very diverse molecules that can be classified by their molecular size (degree of polymerization or DP) into sugars (DP 1–2), oligosaccharides (DP 3–9), and polysaccharides (DP > 9). The physicochemical properties of carbohydrates and their fates within the body are also influenced by their monosaccharide composition and the type of linkage between sugar residues. Examples of food carbohydrates and an overview of their digestive fates are given in Table 5.1.\n",
      "From birth, carbohydrate provides a large part of the energy in human diets, with approximately 40% of the energy in mature breast milk being supplied as lactose. After weaning, carbohydrates are the largest source (40–80%) of the energy in many human diets, with most of this derived from plant material except when milk or milk products containing lactose are consumed. The carbohydrate contents of some vegetable dishes are summarized in Table 5.2.\n",
      "5.2 Digestive fate of dietary carbohydrates As with other food components, the digestive fate of particular carbohydrates depends on their inherent chemical nature and on the supramolecular structures within foods of which they are a part. To be absorbed from the gut, carbohydrates must be broken\n",
      "- 5.4 Nonglycemic carbohydrates Carbohydrates that are not absorbed in the small intestine enter the large bowel, where they are partially or completely broken down by bacteria in the colon by a process called fermentation. McCance and Lawrence in 1929 were the first to classify carbohydrates as “available” and “unavailable.” They realized that not all carbohydrates provide “carbohydrates for metabolism” to the body. They called these carbohydrates “unavailable.” This was a very useful concept because it drew attention to the fact that some carbohydrate is not digested and absorbed in the small intestine, but rather reaches the large bowel where it is fermented. However, it is now realized that it is misleading to talk of carbohydrate as unavailable because some indigestible carbohydrate can provide the body with energy through fermentation in the colon. Thus, “unavailable carbohydrates” are not really unavailable. For this reason, it has been suggested by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO 1998) of the United Nations and World Health Organization that the term “nonglycemic carbohydrates” is more appropriate.\n",
      "Nature of carbohydrates that enter the colon Carbohydrates that enter the colon can be classified either physiologically or chemically. Neither of these classifications is entirely satisfactory because it is difficult to measure the physiologically indigestible carbohydrate and this varies in different people. Further, the chemical structure of carbohydrates does not always predict their physiological behavior.\n",
      "- the enzymes needed to digest the carbohydrates are not present in the small intestine; (3) the enzymes are present but cannot gain access to the carbohydrates; or (4) the enzymes do not digest the carbohydrates rapidly enough for them to be completely absorbed. In addition, a small amount of carbohydrate entering the colon consists of carbohydrate residues occurring on mucopolysaccharides (mucus) secreted by the small and large intestinal mucosal cells.\n",
      "Some carbohydrates are always nonglycemic because the human species lacks the enzymes necessary for their digestion. However, a significant proportion (perhaps up to half ) of all carbohydrates that escape digestion in the small intestine have a chemical structure which is such that they could potentially be digested or absorbed in the small intestine, but they are variably absorbed for various reasons, examples of which are given below.\n",
      "First, some monosaccharides and sugar alcohols are only partially absorbed because of low affinity for intestinal transporters. Xylose is taken up by the glucose transporter, but is only partly absorbed because of a low affinity. Fructose is poorly absorbed on its own, but readily absorbed in the presence of glucose. The surface area of the small intestine available for absorption is reduced by diseases that cause atrophy of the intestinal mucosa, such as tropical sprue or celiac disease, or surgical resection of a portion of the intestine (e.g., for Crohn’s disease). An increased rate of intestinal transit (e.g., high osmotic load in the small intestinal lumen from undigested sugars) reduces the time available for absorption to occur.\n",
      "Second, some individuals have a low or absent intestinal lactase activity; thus, lactose is partly or completely nonabsorbed in these individuals. The availability of pancreatic amylase may be reduced in cystic fibrosis or in individuals whose pancreatic mass has been destroyed by, for example, recurrent pancreatitis.\n",
      "- Third, although starch (amylopectin or amylose) is potentially digested in the small intestine, if it is trapped inside intact cell walls or other plant cell structures, intestinal enzymes may not be able to gain access to it, and therefore it remains undigested. The digestibility of the carbohydrates in banana depends on the degree of ripeness. The starch in green banana is very indigestible, but, as the banana ripens, the starch is converted to digestible sugars.\n",
      "Finally, there are many reasons why carbohydrates may not be digested rapidly enough to be completely absorbed. Some forms of retrograded or resistant starch, or foods with a large particle size, are digested so slowly that the time spent in the small intestine is not long enough for their complete digestion. Digestion of these carbohydrates can be altered by factors that affect transit time. The presence of osmotically active and unabsorbed molecules (such as unabsorbed sugars) will draw water into the intestine and speed the rate of transit. Substances that increase bulk, such as wheat bran, will have similar effects. Transit rate is slowed in old age and in the presence of viscous fibers. Drugs may increase or decrease the rate of transit. Certain disorders can also affect transit time, such as gastroparesis, a complication of type I diabetes.\n",
      "Chemical classification of carbohydrates entering the colon The chemical classification of carbohydrates entering the colon is as follows.\n",
      "● Monosaccharides: all except for glucose, fructose, and galactose are partly or completely unabsorbed. Fructose in the absence of a source of glucose (mono-, di-, or polysaccharide) is partly unabsorbed.\n",
      "● Sugar alcohols: all are partly or completely unabsorbed.\n",
      "● Disaccharides: all except for maltose, sucrose, and lactose are unabsorbed. Lactose is completely or partly unabsorbed in individuals with low intestinal lactase activity.\n",
      "● Oligosaccharides: all are unabsorbed except for maltodextins.\n",
