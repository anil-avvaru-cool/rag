      "In this first, introductory text, the focus is on principles and essentials of human nutrition, with the main purpose of helping the nutrition student to develop a holistic and integrated understanding of this complex, multifaceted scientific domain.\n",
      "1.2 An integrated approach Human nutrition describes the processes whereby cellular organelles, cells, tissues, organs, systems, and the body as a whole obtain and use necessary substances obtained from foods (nutrients) to maintain structural and functional integrity. For an understanding of how humans obtain and utilize foods and nutrients from a molecular to a societal level, and of the factors determining and influencing these processes, the study and practice of human nutrition involve a spectrum of other basic and applied scientific disciplines. These include molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, chemistry, physics, food science, microbiology, physiology, pathology, immunology, psychology, sociology, political science, anthropology, agriculture, pharmacology, communications, and economics. Nutrition departments are, therefore, often found in Medical (Health) or Social Science, or Pharmacy, or Agriculture Faculties at tertiary training institutions. The multidisciplinary nature of the science of nutrition, lying in both the natural (biological) and social scientific fields, demands that students of nutrition should have a basic understanding of many branches of science and that they should be able to integrate different concepts from these different disciplines. It implies that students should choose their accompanying subjects (electives) carefully and that they should read widely in these different areas.\n",
      "- 1.4 Relationship between nutrition and health Figure 1.2 shows that individuals can be broadly categorized into having optimal nutritional status or being undernourished, overnourished, or malnourished. The major causes and consequences of these nutritional states are indicated. It is important to realize that many other lifestyle and environmental factors, in addition to nutrition, influence health and well-being, but nutrition is a major, modifiable, and powerful factor in promoting health, preventing and treating disease, and improving quality of life.\n",
      "1.5 Nutrients: the basics People eat food, not nutrients; however, it is the combination and amounts of nutrients in consumed foods that determine health. To read one must know the letters of the alphabet; to do sums one must be able to count, add, subtract, multiply, and divide. To understand nutrition, one must know about nutrients. The study of nutrients, the ABC and numeric calculations of nutrition, will form a major part of the student’s nutrition journey, and should include.\n",
      "- Nutrients and oxygen are provided to the internal environment by the circulating blood, which also removes metabolic end-products and harmful substances from this environment for excretion through the skin, the kidneys, and the large bowel.\n",
      "The concerted function of different organs and systems of the body ensures that nutrients and oxygen are extracted or taken up from the external environment and transferred to the blood for transport and delivery to the internal environment and cells. The digestive system, for example, is responsible for the ingestion of food and beverages, the breakdown (digestion and fermentation) of these for extraction of nutrients, and the absorption of the nutrients into the circulation, while the respiratory system extracts oxygen from the air. These functions are coordinated and regulated by the endocrine and central nervous\n",

      "• Psychology, pathology, foods, pharmacology, etc. Figure 1.1 Conceptual framework for a holistic, integrated understanding of human nutrition.\n",
      "- ● the consequences of underconsumption and overconsumption of nutrients ● the therapeutic uses of the nutrient ● factors influencing food and nutrition security and food safety.\n",
      "There are more than 50 known nutrients (including amino acids and fatty acids) and many more chemicals in food thought to influence human function and health (Box 1.1). Nutrients do not exist in isolation, except for water and others in some pharmaceutical preparations. In foods, in the gut during digestion, fermentation and absorption, in the blood during transport, and in cells during metabolism, nutrients interact with each other. Therefore, a particular nutrient should not be studied in isolation, but integrated with other nutrients and seen in the context of total body function. The study of nutrition also includes how to determine nutrient requirements to make recommendations for intakes and how nutritional status is monitored by measuring intakes, anthropometry, body composition, biochemical markers reflecting nutritional status, and the clinical signs of malnutrition.\n",
      "This knowledge of nutrients and their functions will enable the nutritionist to advise individuals what and how much to eat. However, this knowledge is not sufficient to understand and address the global problem of malnutrition facing mankind today. This perception has resulted in the cultivation of social science disciplines to support knowledge from the biological sciences to address global malnutrition.\n",
